    # If the fetcher service requires a database, add depends_on below
    # depends_on:
    #   - <database-service>
    # networks:
    #   - stocknet

# No external services (like databases) are defined in the README or code summary.
# If a database is required, add it as a service below and configure accordingly.

# No ports are exposed as none are specified in the Dockerfile or documentation.

# No volumes section is included as there are no persistent data requirements for the fetcher service.

# If inter-service networking is needed in the future, define networks as below:
# networks:
#   stocknet:
#     driver: bridge
